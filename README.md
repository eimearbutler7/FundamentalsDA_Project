# FundamentalsDA_Project (5 credits)

This repository contains the Fundamentals of Data Analysis Project(Nov/Dec 2018).

The primary document is the Jupyter Notebook "FundamentalDA_Project.ipynb".

To run this document you must have installed software to run python code (https://www.python.org/), for example the Anaconda package (https://www.anaconda.com/).

By running each cell in succession, it will generate a dataframe of randomly generated numbers that are somewhat reflective of real life real estate sales data. 

The dataset connected with this jupyter notebook is saved in this GitHUB Repository and must be used. Unfortunately a direct connection to the raw data could not be established (https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-health/immunization/).
